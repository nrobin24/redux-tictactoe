# Tictactoe Redux

## Introduction

In this blog post we'll build a tictactoe game using html, css, and javascript. For the UI rendering we'll use the react library. In order to manage the state we'll use Redux.

The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate an example react/redux application that's a bit more complex than the simple todo app. This post will also show how a game api can contain business logic and be properly abstracted away from our UI. This decoupling would allow us to swap out React for a different view library in the future without rewriting the game logic. Finally, we'll use promises to handle requests to our game API, and we'll catch any errors that the game API gives us in response to invalid move requests and use this information to pass a notification along to the user.
